## ARPG

**Goal:** Create an arena PvP game that is fun, fair and has replay value that can also have an element of RPG for single player storyline. ("Omnes pares creantur" will be the tagline, "All men are created equal" - in Latin)

**Inspiration:** Diablo 2 and Dark Sun: The Shattered Lands

**Stay on Schedule:**

* Set the scope of the game to take about a month to complete
* Break that down into tasks for each week
* Send yourself producer emails (What you accomplished the previous week and what is on the schedule for this coming week) - This could also server as a dev blog

**MVP:**

* Arena battle system
  * Map
    * Contained arena (amphitheater)
    * Weapon rack
  * Ability to move character
    * Either mouse click like D2/LoL or WASD
    * Attack (basic)
    * Attack (special)
* Possible turned based side scroller 2d combat on a tiled map.
  * Certain moves take certain moves to complete, ex: jump attack takes three turns but does 75% damage
  * Ability to dodge or evade attacks
  *

**ADDONS: **

* Select weapon prior to entering arena (this also determines armor)
* Multiplayer capability
* Social interaction
* Single Player Campaign
* Character Customization (Requires additional art)

**Combat System: **

* Real time combat or intentionally delayed combat (1-2 second turns?)
* Do testing between mouse click to move or W, A, S, D
* Abilities either Q, W, E, R or 1, 2, 3, 4 depending which movement keys are used
* Max of 5 abilities at a time - try to make abilities engaging and skillful ex:
  * Abilities do damage based off how difficult they are to land
  * A shot that does 75% damage would have not only a skill shot "arrow" but a bullseye that gets larger and smaller and cannot move once placed at a target area, if the skillshot lands in the bullseye when it's at its smallest point it will do max damage, does less damage the larger the circle is
* Stats that replicate real fighting (stats do increase slightly as the character progresses but these stats are normalized in PvP based off ratios. Someone who builds a lot of dexterity may be fast and can use medium armor, but won't have a lot of health or damage, someone who builds strength will have powerful attacks, have the ability to use any armor but will be slower)
  * The stronger the character is the less agility they have
* Weapons are tied to armor sets
  * Weapons and armor of the Samnites

**Story points (Historically Accurate):**

* Multiple amphitheater's / cities
* Citizens of Rome gathered at these amphitheater's because they believe the gods favored death in the arena - this became a religious event
* Gladiators fought wild animals at breakfast, bears, lions, alligators were brought to the amphitheater's and treated poorly and starved so they would fight
* Lunch time they executed criminals, had singers and dancers and sometimes held plays. Some people would bring a picnic, Peters would get bread and wine from vendors walking around.
* Executed criminals were either beheaded, stabbed and left to bleed out, tied to a post and fed to bears or thrown off a tall structure. They would sometimes get creative because the gods loved justice in watching criminals die
* After lunch gladiators would fight each other, only in big cities did they fight to the death, smaller towns it was until someone got hurt, although sometimes they would die
* When the show was over, the surviving gladiators walked back to their dorm to keep practicing and working out, getting ready for the next show.
* They ate a special diet – mostly vegetarian, bread and beans, with a lot of power drinks made out of vinegar and the ashes of burned plants.
* Gladiators were often, though not always, enslaved – sometimes enslaved African men and women, brought from East Africa to fight in Rome.
